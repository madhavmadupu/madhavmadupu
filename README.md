# Hey, I'm Madhav 👋 

### AI/ML Engineer | Building Autonomous Agentic Systems
**Specializing in LLM Orchestration, Multi-Agent Systems, and Cloud-Native AI**
**Based in Hyderabad, India 🇮🇳**

I build intelligent systems that don't just predict, but **reason and execute**. From local, air-gapped multi-agent frameworks for secure coding to multimodal RAG pipelines on GCP, I focus on turning experimental AI into production-grade infrastructure.
